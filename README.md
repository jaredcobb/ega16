EGA 16
===

Feeling nostalgic for a simpler time? Let's go back!

The Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) was introduced in 1984, and was IBM's first color display card capable of 16 colors at once.

* Full EGA default 16 color palette!
* Customize your 16 color palette from the mind blowing 64 total color palette!
* Compatible with most RGBI monitors (DE-9 connector may be required).
* Works with composite color televisions (thanks to NTSC chroma decoding).
* Backwards compatible with Windows 3.0, OS/2 1.1, and Macintosh Color Classic.
